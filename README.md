# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview of the project
The purpose of the project is to create a report indicating which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how to group them to create a classification system that will be used to provide customers with new cryptocurrency investment portfolios. First, use the StandardScaler function to preprocess the data and standardize features. Then, perform principal component analysis on the data to reduce the data dimension to three components. Next, generate the elbow curve to find the best value of k. The KMeans algorithm is used to predict K clusters of encrypted currency data. Finally, use 3D scatter plots and hvplot scatter plots to visualize the data.
